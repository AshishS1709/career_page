# Career Preference System

## Executive Summary

The Career Preference System is an AI-powered application that analyzes user conversations to extract career preferences and provide personalized career recommendations. The system leverages OpenAI's GPT models and LangChain framework to process natural language conversations and map them to suitable career paths across six major categories: STEM, Arts & Creative, Sports & Fitness, Business & Entrepreneurship, Healthcare & Medicine, and Education & Social Services.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **CareerPreferenceExtractor**: Extracts career-related preferences from conversation text
2. **CareerGuidanceApp**: Main application orchestrating the entire process
3. **Career Database**: Structured repository of career paths and indicators
4. **Recommendation Engine**: Maps user preferences to career suggestions

### Technology Stack

- **Python 3.8+**: Core programming language
- **OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo**: Natural language processing and analysis
- **LangChain**: Framework for building LLM applications
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning utilities for similarity calculations
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing for embeddings and calculations

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

The system requires the following environment variables to be configured in the `.env` file:

```bash
# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Database Configuration  
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///career_preferences.db

# Application Configuration
DEBUG=True
```

### Environment Setup Instructions

1. **Create `.env` file** in the project root directory
2. **Configure API Access**: 
   - Obtain OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with actual API key
3. **Database Setup**: 
   - Default configuration uses SQLite for local development
   - For production, update `DATABASE_URL` to PostgreSQL or MySQL connection string
4. **Debug Mode**: 
   - Set `DEBUG=True` for development environment
   - Set `DEBUG=False` for production deployment

### Security Configuration

The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude sensitive information:

```gitignore
# Environment Variables - Only specific files
.env

# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
```

This ensures that API keys and sensitive configuration data are never committed to version control.

## Core Functionality

### 3. Recommendation Algorithm

The system uses a multi-factor approach to generate recommendations:

1. **Semantic Analysis**: Compares user preferences with career indicators using embeddings
2. **Pattern Matching**: Identifies alignment between user traits and career requirements
3. **Confidence Assessment**: Evaluates the reliability of recommendations
4. **Gap Analysis**: Identifies potential concerns or areas for development

## System Workflow

### Phase 1: Input Processing
1. User provides conversation text describing interests, skills, and goals
2. System preprocesses the text for analysis
3. Confidence threshold check determines if additional information is needed

### Phase 2: Preference Extraction
1. GPT model analyzes conversation using structured prompts
2. Extracts preferences into predefined categories
3. Assigns confidence score based on information clarity
4. Generates clarification questions if confidence is below threshold

### Phase 3: Career Matching
1. Compares extracted preferences with career path indicators
2. Calculates alignment scores for each career category
3. Identifies top 3 most suitable career recommendations
4. Provides detailed explanations for each recommendation

### Phase 4: Output Generation
1. Presents recommendations with alignment scores
2. Highlights matching factors from user preferences
3. Identifies potential concerns or skill gaps
4. Suggests follow-up questions for improvement

## Implementation Features

### Interactive Modes

**Example Demo Mode**: Demonstrates system capabilities using predefined conversation samples

**Interactive Mode**: Real-time conversation processing with iterative refinement

### Confidence-Based Processing

- **High Confidence (70%+)**: Provides direct recommendations
- **Medium Confidence (50-69%)**: Provides recommendations with additional questions
- **Low Confidence (<50%)**: Requests more information before recommending

### Adaptive Questioning

The system generates intelligent follow-up questions when confidence is low:
- "What subjects or activities do you find most engaging?"
- "What type of work environment helps you perform your best?"
- "What does career success look like to you?"
